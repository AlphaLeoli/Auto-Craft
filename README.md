# Auto Craft
Crafts tnt minecarts for you automatically. Configured to me and my friends' settings, so it won't work for you.
If you do want it though, then here are the instructions:

**Setup:**
1. download the zip and extract the file
2. open run.bat

**Minecraft:**
1. download [my texture pack](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/alpha)
2. download [better recipe book](https://modrinth.com/mod/brb)
3. click 'f' on the minecart, tnt minecart, and iron in the recipe book to pin them
4. make sure you have iron blocks and tnt in your inventory and you have the recipe book on
5. turn on instant crafting in the bottom right of your recipe book
6. make sure show craftable is on in the top right of your recipe book
7. go in a crafting table and press 'insert' on your keyboard

If you don't want to do the texture pack part, then instead you can just change the images in the extracted file.
